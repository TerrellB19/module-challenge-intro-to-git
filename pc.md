## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is a free distributed control system kinda like cmd but with its own commands and uses.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is where you access and save code locally, while github is where that code is stored after you upload it for other people to access or as a backup.
3. Why do we create a branch?
So that old code isnt flooded with new code that will cause potential problems.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
To check your code for errors before merging it into the main code.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
$git branch -M main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
Git Fetch lets you donload contents from a remote repository.
Git Merge lets you put forked history back together.
Git pull lets you download content form a remote repository while also updating any changes to your local repository.
7. What is a merge conflict?
Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
By opening the file and making any necessary changes that are causing the conflict.
